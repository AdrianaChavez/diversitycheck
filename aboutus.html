  <h1 class="mission"> Mission </h1>

<p>
Diversity Check values company diversity and inclusivity. Before creating this website,
<br> we saw a problem too many often face: women and minories have no reliable source to
<br>
get the scoop on company statistics and demographic breakdowns.
<br>
<br>
Whether you're weighing two incredible job offers and want to see how you'll fit in,
crave to really know which top companies are sticking to their word of <br>
increasing employee diversity, or are simply curious to know how women are
<br> being incorporated into tech, we hope Diversity Check is your go to
<br> resource for company diversity analytics.

  <h1 class="mission"> Mission </h1>

<p>
Diversity Check values company diversity and inclusivity. Before creating this website,
<br> we saw a problem too many often face: women and minorities have no reliable source to
<br>
get the scoop on company statistics and demographic breakdowns.
<br>
<br>
Whether you're weighing two incredible job offers and want to see how you'll fit in,
crave to really know which top companies are sticking to their word of <br>
increasing employee diversity, or are simply curious to know how women are
<br> being incorporated into tech, we hope Diversity Check is your go to
<br> resource for company diversity analytics.
</p>

  Girls Who Code founder Reshma Saujani. </i>

<p> We are four very determind girls from the AppNexus New York Girls Who Code Summer Immersion
  <br> class of 2017. As women in tech ourselves, we saw a problem many face when trying to find<br>
   an inclusive workspace. We decided to devote the last two weeks of our time in SIP to creating
 <i> Diversity Check </i> to solve this problem. </br>

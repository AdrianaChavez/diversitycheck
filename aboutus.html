<h1>
Mission 
</h1>

<p>
Diversity Check values company diversity and inclusivity. Before creating this website, we saw a problem too many often face: women and minories have no reliable source to get the scoop on company statistics and demographic breakdowns. 
<br>
<br>
Whether you're weighing two incredible job offers and want to see how you'll fit in, crave to really know which top companies are sticking to their word of increasing employee diversity, or are simply curious to know how women are being incorporated into tech, we hope Diversity Check is your go to resource for company diversity analytics.
